1. Overview

A Crop Recommendation System suggests the most suitable crop to grow based on various environmental and soil parameters such as:

Nitrogen (N)

Phosphorus (P)

Potassium (K)

Temperature

Humidity

pH

Rainfall

It uses machine learning models trained on agricultural data to predict which crop will yield best under given conditions.

🧩 2. System Architecture

Input → Processing → Output

Input Layer:
User enters soil and environmental parameters (N, P, K, temperature, humidity, pH, rainfall).

Data Preprocessing:

Handle missing values

Normalize or scale data

Split dataset into train/test sets

Model Training:

Use algorithms like Random Forest, Decision Tree, or SVM

Train the model on historical data

Prediction:

The model predicts the most suitable crop for the given input parameters.

Output Layer:

The predicted crop name is displayed to the user.
