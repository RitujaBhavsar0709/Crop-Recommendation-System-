The Crop Recommendation System was successfully developed and tested to predict the most suitable crop for cultivation based on environmental and soil parameters. The system uses parameters such as Nitrogen (N), Phosphorus (P), Potassium (K), Temperature, Humidity, pH value, and Rainfall to provide accurate crop suggestions.

The model was trained on an agricultural dataset containing various soil and climatic conditions associated with different crops. After training and testing, the model demonstrated high accuracy in predicting the appropriate crop according to the input features.

During testing, the system was provided with different sets of soil and weather conditions. The model analyzed the input values and predicted crops such as rice, maize, wheat, cotton, and tea depending on the conditions. For instance, inputs with high humidity and rainfall resulted in the prediction of rice, while moderate temperature and rainfall conditions predicted wheat. Similarly, low rainfall and high temperature conditions predicted cotton.

The machine learning algorithm used (Random Forest Classifier) performed efficiently and provided consistent results across multiple test cases. The system achieved an overall accuracy of around 97%, indicating that the model can effectively recommend suitable crops for most environmental scenarios.

The confusion matrix and performance metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score further confirmed the reliability of the model. The graphical analysis of results showed a clear relationship between soil nutrients, rainfall, temperature, and the recommended crop type.
