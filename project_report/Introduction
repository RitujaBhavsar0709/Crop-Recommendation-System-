1.1 Introduction

Agriculture plays a vital role in sustaining the economy an
providing food security. One of the major challenges faced by
farmers is selecting the right crop to grow under specific soil
and climatic conditions. Traditionally, farmers rely on experience,
observation, or guesswork to make this decision. 
However, such methods may not always lead to the best results and
can affect productivity and profitability.
With the growth of technology and data-driven approaches, it has
become possible to make farming decisions more scientific and reliable. 
A Crop Recommendation System uses machine learning techniques to suggest 
the most suitable crop based on various factors such as soil nutrients 
(Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Potassium), environmental conditions (temperature, 
humidity, rainfall), and soil pH.By analyzing these parameters, the system
predicts the best crop for a given situation, helping farmers optimize yield
and use resources more efficiently.This project focuses on developing a simple 
crop recommendation tool using a *Decision Tree Classifier*, which provides quick, 
accurate, and easy-to-understand suggestions. The system aims to assist farmers in 
making informed decisions, thereby improving agricultural productivity and supporting 
sustainable farming practices.

1.2 Problem Statement-
Agriculture is the main source of income for many farmers. 
The success of farming mainly depends on choosing the right crop to grow.
Farmers often select crops based on traditional knowledge, experience, or 
guesswork, which may not always give good results. Due to changes in soil 
conditions, climate, rainfall, temperature, and humidity, wrong crop
selection can lead to low yield, financial loss, and wastage of resources.

Farmers face difficulty in analyzing multiple factors such as:
Soil nutrients (Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Potassium)
Soil pH value
Rainfall
Temperature
Humidity

1.3 Objectives
The main objectives of a Crop Recommendation System are:
1.Suggest Suitable Crops
To recommend the most suitable crops for a particular region based on 
soil type, climate, and weather conditions.
2.Increase Crop Yield
To help farmers choose crops that give higher production and better quality.
3.Efficient Use of Resources
To ensure proper use of water, fertilizers, and land by selecting crops suitable 
for available resources.
4.Reduce Crop Failure Risk
To minimize losses caused by unsuitable crop selection, poor soil conditions, or 
climate changes.
5.Support Decision Making
To assist farmers in making informed decisions using data such as rainfall,
temperature, humidity, and soil nutrients.
6.Promote Sustainable Farming
To encourage eco-friendly farming practices by recommending crops that maintain soil health.
7.Improve Farmer Income
To increase profitability by suggesting crops with better market value and yield.
