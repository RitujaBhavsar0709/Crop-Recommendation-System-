1. System Modules Implemented

a. Data Pre-processing Module
Collected soil parameters: Nitrogen (N), Phosphorus (P), Potassium (K), pH, Temperature, Humidity, Rainfall.
Removed missing values, duplicates, and outliers using statistical filtering.
Scaled and normalized the features for consistent model performance.
Generated a clean dataset for model training and testing.

b. Machine Learning Model (Random Forest Classifier)
Implemented Random Forest due to:
High accuracy
Ability to handle nonlinear agricultural data
Resistance to overfitting

Trained the model using the preprocessed dataset (80% training, 20% testing).
Performed hyperparameter tuning:
Number of trees (n_estimators)
Max depth
Min samples split
Achieved improved prediction accuracy for crop recommendations.

c. Market Price Analysis Module
Integrated real-time/recorded market price data for major crops.
Performed:
Trend analysis
Seasonal price variation study
Average price and profit estimation
Linked price insights with crop recommendations so farmers get both:
Technically suitable crops
Economically profitable choices

d. Crop Recommendation Engine
Combined soil data + environmental factors + market price trends.
Generated top 3 suitable crops with:
Suitability score (from Random Forest)
Expected market value or profit score
Ensured final recommendations maximize revenue and productivity.

2. Platform Development / System Integration

a. Backend Implementation
Developed backend in Python (Flask/Django).
Loaded trained Random Forest model (.pkl).
Implemented APIs for:
Predicting best crops
Fetching market price analytics
Displaying comparison graphs

b. Frontend Implementation
User-friendly interface for farmers to input:
N, P, K values
pH, rainfall, humidity
Dashboard for showing results:
Recommended crops
Market price trend charts
Soil condition report

c. Database Setup
Stored:
User soil test history
Market price logs
Prediction results
Database: CSV

3. Testing Phase
Conducted:
Unit testing on model prediction APIs
Integration testing between ML + Market Price module
Real-time data testing using actual soil sample values
Validated accuracy with manual agricultural expert opinions.

4. Outcome of Implementation Phase–II
Successfully deployed a Smart Crop Recommendation System.
Provides both scientific crop prediction and market profit guidance.
Improves decision-making for farmers based on:
Soil suitability
Weather conditions
Market demand and price trends
Achieved high model accuracy and reliable recommendations.
