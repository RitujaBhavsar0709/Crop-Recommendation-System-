Existing Survey of Crop Recommendation Systems
1. Overview & Motivation

Over the last decade research on Crop Recommendation Systems (CRS) has grown rapidly because data-driven recommendations can increase yield, reduce input waste, and support smallholder decision-making. Recent surveys and systematic reviews report a steady rise in publications between 2020–2024, driven by better datasets, cheaper sensors, and wider adoption of ML techniques.

2. Typical input features used

Most CRS models use a small, consistent set of features: soil nutrients (N, P, K), soil pH, local climatic features (temperature, humidity, rainfall), and sometimes historical yield or crop rotations. These variables are widely available in public datasets and are sufficient for many classification systems (predicting the best crop).

3. Common machine-learning approaches

Decision Trees and Random Forests — popular because they are interpretable and handle heterogeneous features; many studies report strong performance with Random Forest ensembles. 
SciSpace

Support Vector Machines (SVM) — used in several comparative studies and sometimes outperform simpler trees depending on dataset characteristics. 
ResearchGate

Ensembles & Boosting (XGBoost, Voting ensembles) — increasingly used to push accuracy higher and stabilize predictions across regions. 
MDPI

Naïve Bayes, K-NN, Logistic Regression — used as baselines or where interpretability or computational simplicity is desired. 
PMC

(Decision-tree based approaches are especially common in educational/intro projects because they give simple rule-like outputs that are easy to explain to farmers.)

4. Datasets & benchmarks

Several publicly available datasets are commonly used for building CRS models (often focused on India):

Kaggle “Crop Recommendation” datasets containing N, P, K, temperature, humidity, pH and rainfall are widely reused for experiments and tutorials.

Figshare and other repositories host augmented/cleaned CRS datasets for reproducibility.

5. Performance & evaluation

Comparative studies report a wide range of accuracies depending on dataset size, number of crop classes, and preprocessing. Ensemble methods and XGBoost often lead the leaderboard in recent comparative works; some small, curated datasets report very high accuracies (90%+), but these might not generalize across regions.

6. Explainability & farmer trust

Interpretability (decision rules, feature importance) is essential for farmer adoption. Recent work couples CRS with explainable AI (XAI) and rule extraction so recommendations can be justified in plain language — an active trend in 2024–2025 research.

7. Limitations & gaps in current literature

Regional generalisability: Many models are trained on limited-region datasets (soil types, climate zones) and perform poorly when transferred.

Temporal robustness: Few studies incorporate seasonal shifts, climate change trends, or multi-year yield dynamics.

Data quality & feature coverage: Public datasets often lack fine-grained soil texture, irrigation, management practice, and socioeconomic variables that affect crop choice.

Real-world deployment & evaluation: There is limited large-scale field validation of CRS recommendations; most work ends at offline accuracy testing.

8. Emerging directions (2023–2025)

Tiny-ML and edge deployment for low-cost on-farm recommendations (models running on local devices). 
ScienceDirect

Integration with remote sensing & IoT sensors to enrich inputs (soil moisture, NDVI) and enable near real-time recommendations.

9. Practical recommendations for your project

Use publicly available NPK-pH-weather datasets (Kaggle / Figshare) for initial training and testing. 
Kaggle

Start with a Decision Tree / Random Forest baseline (interpretable + strong performance), then compare with ensemble methods like XGBoost. 
SciSpace
+1

Report not only accuracy but also per-crop precision/recall, and show feature importance to help explain outputs to users. 
MDPI

If possible, plan a small field trial or expert validation to assess practical usefulness beyond offline metrics.
