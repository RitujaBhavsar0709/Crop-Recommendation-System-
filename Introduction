Agriculture plays a vital role in sustaining the economy and providing food security. One of the major challenges faced by farmers is selecting the right crop to grow under specific soil and climatic conditions. Traditionally, farmers rely on experience, observation, or guesswork to make this decision. However, such methods may not always lead to the best results and can affect productivity and profitability.

With the growth of technology and data-driven approaches, it has become possible to make farming decisions more scientific and reliable. A *Crop Recommendation System* uses machine learning techniques to suggest the most suitable crop based on various factors such as soil nutrients (Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Potassium), environmental conditions (temperature, humidity, rainfall), and soil pH.

By analyzing these parameters, the system predicts the best crop for a given situation, helping farmers optimize yield and use resources more efficiently. This project focuses on developing a simple crop recommendation tool using a *Decision Tree Classifier*, which provides quick, accurate, and easy-to-understand suggestions. The system aims to assist farmers in making informed decisions, thereby improving agricultural productivity and supporting sustainable farming practices.
