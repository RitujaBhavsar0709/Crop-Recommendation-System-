Existing Research
Machine Learning (DT, NB, SVM, LR, RF, XGBoost) used for crop recommendation.
RF & XGBoost often gave highest accuracy.
IoT + ML systems monitored soil nutrients (NPK, pH, temp, humidity).
CNN applied for plant disease detection (image-based).
Yield prediction explored using historical soil & weather data.
Drawbacks Identified
Focus only on suitability, not profitability.
Limited attributes (ignored mandi price & yield/ha).
Many solutions stop at prediction (no economic guidance).
High cost of IoT sensors, lack of simple farmer tools.
Our Contribution
RF-based crop recommendation with high accuracy.
Integration of mandi price data + yield/ha.
Suggests Top 3 crops ranked by profitability.
Visualization with bar charts for easy decision-ming.
